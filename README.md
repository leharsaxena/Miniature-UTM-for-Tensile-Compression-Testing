# Miniature-UTM-for-Tensile-Compression-Testing
This project involves developing a miniature Universal Testing Machine (UTM) for tensile and compression testing. It aims to be a compact, cost-effective, and efficient alternative to large UTMs while ensuring accuracy. The design phase, based on theories of failure and structural analysis, is complete; fabrication is about to begin.
